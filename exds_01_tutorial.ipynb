    "# exds_01: Data Cleaning (Tutorial)\n",
    "Recall from the last tutorial that the definition of data science we provided you with includes this idea of making <b>data understandable and actionable</b>. Oftentimes, large companies face issues with what is known as \"messy data\" or data that is not actionable simply because it is too disorganized to conduct meningful analysis. Some of the the most typical characteristics of this include\n",

    "* identify outliers\n",
    "* overall implausibility\n",
    "* typos\n",
    "* variables with strange names or values\n",
    "* mismatched data types (eg. a column of numerical data should not be of type `str`)\n",
    "* unnecessary or unimportant variables\n",
    "\n",
    "amongst many others. As data scientists, it is our job to fix these and any other issues in the data (within ethical reason of course!) so that we or our employer can make decisions based on data that is as representative of reality and easy to interpret as possible. Fortunately, we have many tools to accomplish such tasks, one being a Python library that you are by now hopefully familiar with, `pandas`! In this example, we will use `pandas` to clean a dataset from the file called `BL-Flickr-Images-Book.csv`. You will need to download both this [csv file](https://github.com/realpython/python-data-cleaning/blob/master/Datasets/BL-Flickr-Images-Book.csv) and a [txt file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realpython/python-data-cleaning/master/Datasets/university_towns.txt). Put both into the same directory as this notebook file.\n",

    "Now, let's continue cleaning things up. In the case of our data, someone accessing it might want to be able to locate the book with `Identifier` 480, but they aren't able to yet since Python sees the `Identifier` as just another piece of data that describes each literary work, not an index, so let's fix that now using the `pandas` function `set_index()`. This function takes a `str` which represents the column name you want to use as your index and `inplace` means the same thing as it did in `drop()`. Before we do this, we must test that our desired column contains unique values for each literary work. See the code below for our demonstration of this."
